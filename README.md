## Please be aware this repo is used for both testing features for my main website and also as my GitHub page.

## Some features that are on here may not function properly or may be different from those featured on my main website.  This will be due to the way GitHub pages work. 

### Please be aware that the contact form at the bottom of this page does not function on GitHub pages (as it required PHP), for this reason i have disabled all of the input functions on the page.  If you would like to get in contact with me then please do so via one of my social media accounts or via email @ matt@mwn-design.co.uk. 

### Below is a list of features that do not work on GitHub pages or are different on my main website.
